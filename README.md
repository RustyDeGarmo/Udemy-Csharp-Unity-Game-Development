# Udemy-Csharp-Unity-Game-Development
Udemy course for learning game development with C# and Unity

Key Points to Remember:

Have some sort of an image whether it's on the computer or hand sketched so we have an idea of what we're building.

Make a note of and keep in mind:
	* Player Experience - What should the player feel, e.g. nimble/agile (Helps make decisions while building the game)
	* Core Mechanic - e.g. Move and dodge obstacles
	* Game Loop - e.g. Get from A to B without hitting obstacles

Theme:  
Ricky is a prototype AI spacecraft exploring the depths of an unknown planet. His mission was to report on the condition of the planet but he went too deep and now the transmission can't break through and he has to try to escape. It almost seems like the environment itself is animated with a malevolent desire to keep Ricky from escaping! It's as if the planet itself lulled Ricky into a false sense of safety to get him to go too deep. Now, the closer Rickey gets to escaping the harder the planet tries to keep him.
